# Polyam Infinity Heart
Arduino code for my LED Polyamory Infinity Heart art piece.  It combines an infinity sign with a constantly rotating rainbow, wrapped around a red heart that pulses with my own heartbeat at 1/4 speed.

## Materials



## Heart rate data
The data used for the pulsing heart was created by taking an ECG reading using
an Apple Watch, exporting an image of the rhythm, and then using a [web based tool](https://www.graphreader.com/) to convert that to x,y graph values.  I then used the y values for the heart brighness.
